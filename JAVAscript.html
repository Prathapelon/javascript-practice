    <h4>introduction to JAVA SCRIPT</h4>
    <P>java Script is easiest language in softwere domain 
        <span>java script is a both clint side and server side programmeing language </span>
        it is 
        <div> <h4>it is used to perform the actions on the web page and to make web sites interactive with the user</h4></div>
        <div>java script introduced in the year 1995 by the PERSON BRENCLIN EICH</div>
        <P> JAVA script used introduced for a COMPANY CAllED as NETSCAPE</P>
        <span> creating java script :=  alert("HI GUYS") IT is not work like html so creat DEMO.JS IN ONE file and run it in HTML PAGE by creating in body by useing tag like "SCRIPT LINK " Link it to the HTML PAGE </span>
       <b> <h4>clint end java script will run with the help of browers softweres such as chrome ,fire fox.eic..</h4></b>
       <p>JRE and JVM IS PERSENT  in the JAVA SCRIPT ENGINE without engin we con't run the java script is," made by c++" </p>
       <p style="color: blue;">ABOUT THE BACK END :=  RUN EXCEPT browsers : bu using the NODE JS introduced in 2009 it is back end language  <br></p>
       <p>server  side JAVA sCRIPT  will run with the NODE JS  is used the google's V8 ENGIN 
spider monkey is relesed for NETSCAPE </P>
finally google introduced the ENGIN in the --- in i.e V8 IS very fast 
OPERA introduced ENGIN called caraken
fire fox used only spider monkey 
edge used CHAKRA introducad by indians </p>
<span>
java script engin is used by all the browers and also node js uses java Script engin in order to run and execute java script code <br></span>
    all the different browers are having different different java Script engins like  crome is having google's V8 has the engin <br>
    opera having caraten <br>   
    fire fox is having spider monkey <br>
    edge havind CHAKRAbr
    <p> first introducad as java script 1 in 1995 <br>
        secon introduce in 1996 <br> ECMA ( THEY took all the info ):[European Computers manufacture associations ] then it is ECMA script in 1997 <br>
        2015 majar updation as most like JAVA language <br>
        tnow it is 2021 version 

    </p>
    <span> </span>
    <script> alert("hi prathap wait a bit")</script>
      <script src="./external link "></script>
<p><h3> TYPES OF jAVA SCRIPT</h3> <b><li>internal     </li></b>: write internal java script we use HTML TAG we use inside Script tag to code java script  to run the java script we need to run the HTML FILE in lthe browers softwere<b> <li>external java Script </li></b>: we used JS to code in order run js we need to link external js file to the HTML by using script 
</p>
<span> semi colon is not mandatory in JS to terminate line of code </span>
<h2>properties of JAVA SCRIPT </h2>
<div> java script is also flatform independent  &nbsp;&nbsp;  java is platform independent  <br>
    JS is loosely typed language  <br>
JS is single and multiple threaded operations <br>   
JS is clint and server side language <br>
JS OBJECT based programming language <br>
JS is scripting and programmeing language <br>
 JS is interpreter programmeing language <br> </div> <BR></BR>
 <SCRIPt> document.getElementById("abc").innerText</SCRIPt>
 <BR></BR>
 <H2>WELCOME TO JS :㊗ </H2><script></script>

<script>
    let x;
    x = "world is full of illution" ㊗ 
    console.log(x);

<script src="./app.js"></script>
<h3>variabLes in JS</h3>
<p><LI>LET</LI><LI>VAR</LI> <LI>CONST</LI></p>
<H3>KEY WORDS</H3>
<span>key words to declare variables in java Script : VAR,LET ,CONST</span>
<P > VAR : is the oldest keyword to declare variables in java Script <br>
    in 2015 ES 2015 version of java script let and const introduced <br>
VAR : usiin ver keyword we can declare initialise , reinitialise and redclare the variables <br>
LET:=using let keyword we can declare ,initialise,and reinitailise the variables ,redecalareation is not possible with LET keyword <br>
<b> CONST </b>: USING const  keyword we can declare the variable and initialise the variable at a time or in the same line  <br>*> it is like a final keyword where we con't change the valve if variable throughtout the code <br> *> in const reinitialisation and redeclaration is not possible <br><BR></BR>
<u> <i> NOTE</i> </u>:<h4>THE value of declared variable in JS without being initialise is undefined <br>
a declared variable in JS can accept or can store any type of data number, boolean ,
String ..etc </h4>
</P>
PRIMITIVE:number ,String, boolean,null,underdefined; <br>
NON-PRIMITIVE:array, object , function,String; <br>
<H4>DATA TYPES in JS </H4>: it is used to define a value into the variables <br>
types of data types : <li>PRIMITIVE data tupes: String  </li> <li> NON-PRIMITIVE data types 
</li>
<li>number</li>: all the different types of number like interger double flout long short bite are  considered as number in JS <br> 
to check the datatype of a variable we use "typeof"operation in JS 
<LI>STRINGS</LI>: in JS we can declare String as "__",'__' and also using tilt symbols
<li>BOOLEAN</li>:in boolean we have true and false 
<li>UNDEFINED</li>:the valsue of a declare variables with be initialise is undefined and the data type of undefenied variables is also undefined ;
<li>NULL</li>: THE value of a null variable is null i,e nothing but empty, or something which is not existing in the memory.data type of null is OBJECT .


<h4>operators in JS </h4>: difereance btw == and ===
<li>==</li>: check the operator based on the valves not the data type : it is not a stricly cheked operator in    ( 10=="10 ")= TRUE ;
<LI>===</LI>: OPEARATOR CHECK THE cdondition based on both values and the data type so it is strictly checked oparators (10==="10")= false


   <li>switch</li> : it is alternative for else if 
   here we can check more than one condition

   <link rel="stylesheet" href="functions.js">

  <H4> functions in JS,......</H4> 
    <div>therer are three types of functions JS <li>genaral or normal function</li> <li>anonymous unction</li>  <li>arrow function </li> </div>
    different baheverous 
    <p>a function without paramaeter and return statment</p>
    <p>a function with parameters and return statement </p>
    <p>a function with patrameter but without return statements</p>
    <p>a function without paarameter but with return statement</p>
    <h5>syntax to create anonymous function </h5>
    <h4>key word variable name =function (para){//cod to execute}
        calling :variable name(arguments0)
        example: let sum =function (a,b){return a+b}
        console.log(sum(1,2));
    </h4>
    <li><h4>anonymous function nothing but a function ith out name </h4></li>
    anonymous function will be stored into the variables so that thouse variables can be used as function name <li><h3>hoisting :it is default behaviour of java Script of moving all the declarations to the top of thie scope .HOISTING IS POSSIBLE ONLY with VAR keyword adn it is only for the declaration not for the initialisastions </h3>is dicviding into two types one is variable hoistin g and FUNCTIONAL hoisting </li>hoisting not possible with let and const KEY WORD becouse of the tempotral dead ZONE in JS 
    <li>whst is temporal dead zone: is the area where VARIABLE is inaccesable untill and unless it is completely initialise with a value</li> hoisting i function declaration and function expression : a JS function can be a function declaration or a function expreesion .HOISTIONG is possible only in function declaration becouse hoisting is process of moving declaration to the top their scope
<li>in function expressioin hosting is not possible becouse initialiasastion con't be moved to the top of scope </li>example to proove HOISTING IN varible declaration x=10;
console.log(x)// ans:10;var x;{hoistiong code}
var x;  console.log(x)//Undefined x=10;{not hoisting code }
<h4>examole to prove FUNCTION HOISTING :clg(greet())hello  function greet(){return"hello";
</h4>clg(greet())//error  var greet =function (){return "hello "};
<li>SCOPE OF VARIABLES IN JAVA SCRIPT : THE varibales declared with var keyword are global scoped  i.e we can access the VARIABKES outside the block but in FUNCTION block VAR IS  a local keyword i.e VARIABELS decalred with VAR keyword insid the function BLOCK CON'T BE access out side the block </li>
<li>LET AND CONST keyword are local scoped i.e we con't access the varibales which are declared with LET AND CONST OUTISDE THE BLOCK LET ANDCONST are local in all the blocks  </li>
<li>ARRAY </li>:IT is used to store multiple values in to a single variable JS array will not be having fixed length i.e we can store as many as values we want. in an array 
<li>JS ARARAY is: both heterogenious and homogenous ;</li>
<li>index value :for all the array elements one unique indentity will be present that can be record as index valve of the elements or index possition of the array elements </li>
<li>INDEX values always starts from zero </li><BR></BR>
<li><u>LENGTH OF ARRAY LENGTH </u></li>: to find the length of the array we use length property example :(array.length)
<LI>array elements can be access useing index possition example :array[index value]</LI>
<LI>the data type of the array in JS is object </LI>
